WEEKLY LOG: Focusing on program goals and addressing issues that arise during the development of the INTERACT project.
            INTERACT is an OpenCV project dealing with computer vision and designing applications using hand tracking.

PHASE 1: June 25, 2014 

done    1. Convert thresh_img to uint8 since openCV functions are picky.  

done    2. Test and debug ranges to isolate as much of a hand ROI as possible

done    3. Create an avg depth function that takes an image of only the thresholded hand ROI. 
           Calculate the avg depth of all pixels that consist of that Hand object.  

done    4. Plot avg distance (y-axis) versus time (x-axis) to get an idea of what a clicking motion looks like.

PHASE 2: July 2, 2014

done    1. Write incoming data to a text file for graphing using R Code, because real-time plotting significantly slows the program down.
           Problems: When writing to the text file only the most recent data string "time avg_depth" string is recorded. 
           Ideas: Try writing data, then write a newline separately after initial data is entered.
                  Might be possible that when the file is opened for writing mode "w" that the previously entered data is cleared out. 
                  Only the next dataline is stored, resulting in just one data entry once the program finishes.   
           Solution: Change open file mode to appending mode "a" to allow new data to be inserted at the end of the file without 
                     overwriting the file containing the previous data line entry.   
           Completed: July 5, 2014
    
    2. Optimize and calculate appropriate resizing measurements needed to improve hand/mouse control to magnify the impact of 
       hand motion on the position of the mouse.

    3. Define a standard click wave by using R code. Focus on how to determine what is the baseline.

    4. Incorporate dynamic time warp using the defined standard click wave for mouse integration.  

    5. Create function that isolates a single Hand object for a constantly changing distance according to the platforms's resolution. 
       Hint: Use bounding box and keep in mind that the pixels which make up a hand object are sensitive at significantly different 
       distances from the depth camera.

    6. Consider benefits of creating a window for user to place their hand to initiate the tracking for the remainder of the program.
